This information is utilized to determine the appropriate Services to quote you. While this financial data may include personal information, we do not control its content. We only use it as part of your financial transactions data to assess the suitable Services for quoting. If you provide this sample financial data, we store it in our email and file storage systems and analyze it using software tools provided by our service providers.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p><strong>Operation of Our Corporate Website</strong></p>
        <p>Cookies and Tracking Technologies: In adherence to applicable laws, CFO Advisors, our service providers, and other third-party website service providers whose services we employ on our corporate website utilize commonly-used tools such as cookies, web beacons, pixels, local shared objects, local storage, event trackers, and other tracking technologies (collectively referred to as &quot;Cookies&quot;) to recognize your visit and monitor your interactions with our corporate website, including subpages.</p>
        <p>We leverage this tracking data to manage our corporate website effectively. For instance, we use Cookies to personalize and enhance your experience on our corporate website, as well as to record your preferences. If you identify yourself on our corporate website, such as by completing a web form, we match your identifying information with a Cookie associated with you (which does not identify you by name, email, or phone number). This matching aids in analyzing the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, communicating with you, providing relevant information, and determining sales efforts tailored to your company.</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s important to note that third-party website service providers may collect personal information from visitors to our websites for their own purposes.</p>
        <p>Additionally, we utilize Google Analytics to analyze visitor interactions with our corporate website. When visiting a website with Google Analytics enabled, the URL of the webpage and your internet protocol address are sent to Google for analytics services. Google also reads Google Analytics Cookies placed on your browser when you visit our corporate website. Please refer to Google&#x27;s Privacy &amp; Terms for more information.</p>
        <p>Social Media Features: Our corporate website incorporates social media features (e.g., buttons) enabling content sharing on social media platforms (&quot;Social Media Features&quot;). These may collect your internet protocol address, the page you are visiting within our corporate website, and may set a Cookie to enable proper feature functionality. Interactions with these features are subject to the privacy policy of the company providing the relevant Social Media Features.</p>
        <p>Links to Other Sites: Our corporate website contains links to other websites with privacy practices that may differ from those of CFO Advisors. If you visit or submit personal information to any of these sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We recommend carefully reading the privacy policy of any website you visit.</p>

The information is linked to a cookie ID. Opt-out options for re-targeted advertising from CFO Advisors can be accessed through the opt-out pages of the Network Advertising Initiative and the Digital Advertising Alliance. Residents of California or Virginia may also opt-out of our corporate website placing targeting Cookies by clicking the &quot;Do not sell or share my personal information&quot; link at the bottom of our corporate website. Note that this does not opt you out of receiving generic ads.</p>
        <p>Retention of Information for Prospective Customers: We retain your business contact information and related sales and marketing activity in our systems to maintain records of relationships, analyze and improve efforts and services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce agreements, complete transactions, and prevent fraud. This information is generally retained until either your request for deletion or our determination that it is no longer needed for marketing and selling services to your employer. Business email addresses may be retained indefinitely for record-keeping of email marketing opt-out or deletion requests.</p>
        <p>If you have not identified yourself on our website, the primary marketing tool we use to monitor website and email marketing activity deletes records of your visit or email engagement starting 90 days or 365 days after your last activity, following their retention policies. Retention of internet activity information collected by third-party website service providers is determined by the applicable third party.</p>

        <p><strong>INFORMATION FOR CUSTOMERS</strong></p>
        <p>This section is relevant if you are affiliated with one of our customers and seek to understand how we handle personal data in the context of providing our Services and managing our business.</p>
        <p><strong>Information Processing:</strong></p>
        <p>In the provision of our Services, we process three categories of data: Customer Data, Business Records Data, and Administrative Data. The following sections elaborate on each data category, outlining the purposes of processing and the duration of retention. The &quot;General Information&quot; section details disclosures of personal information beyond CFO Advisors.</p>
        <p><strong>Customer Data:</strong></p>
        <p>Customer Data comprises information provided by our customers or at their direction for the provision of services, including financial and business information. This information may be sourced directly from customers or authorized third-party data repositories. Examples include transaction data from payment processing services, payroll providers, or other relevant service providers. It may also involve metadata from these repositories.</p>
        <p>This data may include personal information such as identifiers, names of individuals, relationships with our customers, commercial or employment-related information, and details related to entities. For tax preparation, it may encompass corporate officers&#x27; and directors&#x27; names, ownership information, business contact details, and social security numbers. Stock administration services may involve employment status, personal contact information, and social security numbers.</p>
        <p>Customer Data also includes financial information generated during service provision, such as reports of financial data and statements prepared on behalf of customers. For long-term customers subscribing to multiple services, information from prior years may be used for current services.</p>
        <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> Customers grant us access to third-party systems, and the information practices of these third parties are governed by their respective privacy policies and data governance programs, beyond CFO Advisors’s control.</p>
        <p><strong>How we use Customer Data:</strong></p>
        <p>We process Customer Data on behalf of customers to provide, monitor, and improve our Services. This includes:</p>
        <ul role="list">
          <li>Reviewing reconciliations and preparing financial statements.</li>
          <li>Creating automated rules for efficiency.</li>
          <li>Testing and analyzing new features.</li>
          <li>Making product development investments based on customer behavior trends.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additionally, we may process Customer Data for customer service, technical support, and research purposes. In research, we may share non-identifiable information about customers for academic, marketing, or promotional purposes.</p>
        <p><strong>Retention of Customer Data:</strong></p>
        <p>Except as discussed for Business Records Data, tax-related Customer Data is retained for at least seven years, and other Customer Data is retained for post-termination assistance, legal obligations, dispute resolution, agreement enforcement, transaction completion, and fraud prevention. The retention period generally extends until we receive a deletion request, and we take steps to remove or de-identify non-Business Record Data. Former customer credentials are queued for deletion 120 days after the relationship ends.</p>
        <p><strong>Business Record Data:</strong></p>
        <p>In delivering our Services, our personnel communicate with customer representatives through various channels, generating Business Record Data.
