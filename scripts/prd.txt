**Company Overview:** CFO Advisors is redefining how venture-backed startups operate by building best-in-class operational frameworks that power the fastest-growing startups backed by Sequoia, A16z, Bessemer, and visionary leaders like Sam Altman. Our clients trust CFO Advisors to help them create a sustainable competitive advantage by instilling transparency, alignment, accountability, autonomy, and velocity throughout their organization.

**Value Proposition:** Provides startups with operational frameworks and AI-enabled tools to achieve sustainable competitive advantage through enhanced operational efficiency and strategic financial management.

# Core Features  
1.  **Self-Hosting:** Host the exported Webflow site (from `/website` folder) independently.
2.  **Form Modification:** Replace the existing form layout with a pop-up modal triggered by the "Connect with CFO Advisors" button. The modal will include fields for Name, Title, Company Name, Email, and "What would you like help with?".
3.  **Content Update:** Revise website text and content to align with the company's mission, overview, and positioning as described.
4.  **Testimonial Carousel:** Implement a rotating carousel to display client testimonials (code to be provided).

# User Experience  
-   **User Personas:** Startup founders, executives, and operational leaders seeking financial/operational expertise.
-   **Key User Flows:**
    -   User lands on the self-hosted website.
    -   User reads updated content reflecting CFO Advisors' mission and value proposition.
    -   User clicks the "Connect with CFO Advisors" button.
    -   A modal form appears, prompting for contact and request details.
    -   User fills out and submits the form (submission mechanism TBD).
    -   User interacts with a rotating carousel showcasing client testimonials.
-   **UI/UX Considerations:** Ensure the pop-up form is seamless, intuitive, and visually consistent with the site's design. The testimonial carousel should be engaging but not distracting. Content updates must be clear, concise, and compelling.

# Technical Architecture  
-   **System Components:**
    -   Static web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache, or cloud service like Netlify/Vercel) to host exported Webflow files (HTML, CSS, JS).
    -   Frontend JavaScript to handle the form pop-up logic (event listeners, modal display) and the testimonial carousel functionality.
    -   Potential backend/third-party service for form submission handling (e.g., Formspree, Netlify Forms, serverless function sending email).
-   **Data Models:**
    -   Form Submission: { name: string, title: string, companyName: string, email: string, helpRequest: string }
    -   Testimonial: { quote: string, author: string, titleCompany: string } (Structure TBD based on provided code)
-   **APIs and Integrations:** TBD based on the chosen form submission solution.
-   **Infrastructure Requirements:** Hosting environment capable of serving static files and potentially running serverless functions if needed for form handling.

# Development Roadmap  
-   **Phase 1 (MVP):**
    -   Set up basic self-hosting for the site exported to `/website`.
    -   Implement the "Connect with CFO Advisors" button click event to trigger a basic pop-up modal.
    -   Add the required form fields (Name, Title, Company, Email, Help Request) to the modal without final styling.
    -   Update critical website text (e.g., hero section, mission statement) based on the provided content.
    -   Identify all sections requiring content updates.
-   **Phase 2 (Enhancements):**
    -   Integrate the provided testimonial carousel code and populate it with sample data.
    -   Style the pop-up form to match the website's aesthetic.
    -   Implement the chosen form submission mechanism (requires decision: email, webhook, etc.).
    -   Complete the content update across all identified sections, incorporating the provided Role Summary where appropriate.
    -   Ensure responsiveness of the new form modal and testimonial carousel.

# Logical Dependency Chain
1.  **Setup Hosting:** Configure the environment to serve the static site from `/website`. (Foundation)
2.  **Core Content Update:** Modify key text elements (hero, mission) for immediate impact. (Quick Visibility)
3.  **Form Trigger & Structure:** Implement the button click handler and the basic HTML structure for the pop-up modal.
4.  **Form Fields:** Add input fields to the modal.
5.  **Carousel Structure:** Add the placeholder/structure for the testimonial carousel.
6.  **Form Submission Logic:** Implement the backend or third-party integration for form data handling.
7.  **Styling:** Apply CSS to the form modal and carousel to match the site design.
8.  **Carousel Integration:** Integrate provided code and finalize carousel functionality.
9.  **Full Content Update:** Revise remaining website content sections.
10. **Testing & Refinement:** End-to-end testing and responsive checks.

# Risks and Mitigations  
-   **Risk:** Complexity of modifying exported Webflow code (potentially obfuscated CSS/JS).
    *   **Mitigation:** Carefully inspect exported code. Isolate custom JS/CSS changes. Prioritize clean, maintainable additions over modifying obfuscated code directly.
-   **Risk:** Defining and implementing a reliable form submission process.
    *   **Mitigation:** Clearly define requirements (where does data go?). Start with a simple third-party service (e.g., Netlify Forms, Formspree) before building custom solutions.
-   **Risk:** Ensuring consistent styling and responsiveness for new elements (modal, carousel).
    *   **Mitigation:** Reuse existing site styles/classes where possible. Perform thorough testing across different browsers and screen sizes.
-   **Risk:** Accurately reflecting the brand's positioning in the content update.
    *   **Mitigation:** Iteratively review content changes with stakeholders. Use the provided mission/overview/role text as a direct source.

# Appendix  
-   Testimonial carousel sample code will be provided by the stakeholder at a later stage.
-   The exact mechanism for handling form submissions needs to be decided (e.g., send to specific email, integrate with CRM, store in database).
-   The source Webflow export files are located in the `/website` directory.
